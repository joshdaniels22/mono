# mono
A repository to include all reference info and config I need to access across all devices.

The idea is that instead of having lots of disorganised notes, I have one central place for all of them which I am continuously updating to keep it tidy and stay relevant.

## TODO
- [ ] Add .rc file config
- [ ] Consider adding a task to add the .rc config to your .rc file
- [ ] Add config to automate the download of some of the tools I like. i.e. batcat, nnn, tldr, eza.
- [ ] Add script to install ansible
